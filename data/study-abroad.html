   Study Abroad:
  </a>
 </strong>
 We are known for plentiful and diverse study abroad programs. Each year, more than 800 students study off-campus! Academic programs take place in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, North, South and Central America and the Pacific. Some programs extend the scope of particular majors, language concentrations or area studies; all add a cross-cultural dimension to a liberal arts education.
