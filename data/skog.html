 The shorthand version of Skoglund (pronounced Skog·lund) Center. Skoglund hosts varsity basketball and volleyball games in its 2,008-seat arena, and its natatorium is home to the men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams. Skoglund also has a field house, racquetball courts, wrestling room, sauna, locker rooms, an athletic training room, and the athletic department offices. Outdoor tennis courts are located behind the building, near the softball, baseball and soccer fields. In addition to housing athletics, Skoglund Center is used for large ensemble performances, including the annual Christmas Festival.
