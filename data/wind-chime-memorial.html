   Wind Chime Memorial

 </strong>
 In the middle of the Quad, stands a beautiful wind chime. Built by members of the St. Olaf community over the summer of 2003, this Scandinavian-style wooden tower commemorates the lives of students who have died while enrolled at St. Olaf. The chimes, tuned to the key of D (the key of Beautiful Savior), are engraved with the names of those students. On windy days, the sound of the chimes can be heard almost everywhere on campus.
