 The Marijuana e-CheckUpToGo is an interactive web survey that allows college and university students to enter information about their marijuana habits and receive feedback about their use of marijuana. The confidential assessment takes about 7-8 minutes to complete, is self-guided, and requires no face-to-face contact time with a counselor or administrator.
