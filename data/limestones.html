 The famous, seven-voice male a cappella group founded in 1989. The Limestones have grown over the years, working through an exciting evolution of a cappella singing. They have incorporated a more contemporary pop style of music, and have performed throughout the Midwest for schools, businesses, private functions, and have also performed in such places as The Ordway Center in St. Paul, MN and on Garrison Keillorâ€™s Prairie Home Companion.
