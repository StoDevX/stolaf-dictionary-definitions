 The Disability and Access Center is located in the ASC and gives students an opportunity to access academics differently and work with professional staff to establish accommodations with respect to disabilities ranging from physical to learning. Students who have not yet been evaluated for a disability but suspect that there might be a barrier to their academics can also work with a professional staff member. Buntrock 108.
