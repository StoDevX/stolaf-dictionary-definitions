 Named for the Norwegian immigrant, Ole E. Rølvaag (pronounced Røl·vaag) (1876-1931), novelist, educator, and St. Olaf graduate, Rølvaag Memorial Library was completed in 1942 and is the main library on campus. The many group study rooms, computer labs, and quiet nooks provide students with any area to call their own.
