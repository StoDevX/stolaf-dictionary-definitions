   Mohn:
  </a>
 </strong>
 One of the two towers on campus, Mohn (pronounced Moan) is a ten-story residence hall housing 307 students. The hall, which traditionally houses first-year and sophomore students by floor, offers a main lounge, a recreational room, and a piano room. The circular arrangement of each corridor creates a strong community atmosphere.
