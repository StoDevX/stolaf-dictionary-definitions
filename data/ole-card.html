 The all-in-one I.D. card for all students. The Ole Card is used to eat meals in the Caf, buy coffee and snacks at the Cage, get a sweet treat at the Pause, purchase school supplies at the Bookstore, print documents for class, AND get students into their halls at night. The Ole Card carries “Flex dollars” in addition to “Ole dollars.” Flex dollars is the amount of money a student has to use at the Cage/Norway Valley Cafe, and only the Cage/Norway Valley Cafe. Ole dollars is the amount of money a student puts on their own Ole Card. Student do not have to deposit money on their cards, but it makes for an easy transaction around campus
